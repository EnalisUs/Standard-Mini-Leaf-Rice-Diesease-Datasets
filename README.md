# Standard-Mini-Leaf-Rice-Diesease-Datasets
This study uses a dataset of rice leaf disease images, which is partially provided by the Mekong Delta Rice Research Institute. Additional images of rice leaf diseases with varying sizes were collected from various sources, including previous studies, GitHub, and Kaggle, to create a dataset of 4 disease types and healthy rice leaf images. The diseases on rice leaves include Brown Spot, Blast, Leaf Smuf, and Bacterial Blight, which account for 12364 images, while healthy rice leaves account for 4158 images. Most of the images in the dataset were provided and taken by different sources and devices, so the image sizes varied significantly, ranging from a minimum of 64 x 64 px to a maximum of 1816 x 4032 px. After preprocessing the dataset, two sets of data were created for training the CNN model to recognize rice leaf diseases: a standard dataset (SD) with a size of 320 x 320 px and a mini-sized dataset (MSD) with a size of 32 x 32 px.
